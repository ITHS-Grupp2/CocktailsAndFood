      "motivation": "A Gluten Free Burger with Bacon tends to have a robust flavor profile with the salty richness from the bacon. Pairing it with a classic Vodka Martini complements this robust flavor with a clean and refreshing drink. The neutral character of the vodka allows the flavors from the burger to shine through and provides a balanced taste experience.",

      "motivation": "A Greasy Burger may require a drink with enough complexity to match its flavor. Negroni, a cocktail with a unique combination of bitterness, sweetness, and herbal notes, complements the greasy and rich flavor of a Greasy Burger.

Gin and Soda, a simple cocktail with hints of herbs and citrus, is an excellent choice to soothe the heat from the spicy burger.
